      <h2>the first land on the moon</h2>
      <p>
        Apollo 11 (July 16–24, 1969) was the spaceflight that first landed
        humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz
        Aldrin formed the American crew that landed the Apollo Lunar Module
        Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC. Armstrong became the first person
        to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21
        at 02:56 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later. They spent about two
        and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected 47.5
        pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth. Command
        module pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module Columbia alone in
        lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin
        spent 21 hours, 36 minutes on the lunar surface, at a site they had
        named Tranquility Base upon landing, before lifting off to rejoin
        Columbia in lunar orbit. Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket
        from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, on July 16 at
        13:32 UTC, and it was the fifth crewed mission of NASA's Apollo program.
        The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a command module (CM) with a
        cabin for the three astronauts, the only part that returned to Earth; a
        service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion,
        electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had
        two stages—a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage
        to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit. After being sent to the
        Moon by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the
        spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Sea
        of Tranquility on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle's ascent stage to
        lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command
        module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that
        propelled Columbia out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a
        trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and splashed down in
        the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space.
        Armstrong's first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live TV
        to a worldwide audience. He described the event as "one small step for
        man, one giant leap for mankind. Apollo 11 effectively proved US victory
        in the Space Race to demonstrate spaceflight superiority, by fulfilling
        a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, "before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him
        safely to the Earth.

      <h3>the first nasa launch ever</h3>
      <p>
        began in the 20th century following theoretical and practical
        breakthroughs by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Robert H. Goddard, and Hermann
        Oberth. First successful large-scale rocket programs were initiated in
        the 1920s Germany by Fritz von Opel and Max Valier, and eventually in
        Nazi Germany by Wernher von Braun.[2] The Soviet Union took the lead in
        the post-war Space Race, launching the first satellite,[3] the first
        man[4] and the first woman[5] into orbit. The United States caught up
        with, and then passed, their Soviet rivals during the mid-1960s, landing
        the first man on the Moon in 1969. In the same period, France, the
        United Kingdom, Japan and China were concurrently developing more
        limited launch capabilities. Following the end of the Space Race,
        spaceflight has been characterized by greater international
        co-operation, cheaper access to low Earth orbit and an expansion of
        commercial ventures. Interplanetary probes have visited all of the
        planets in the Solar System, and humans have remained in orbit for long
        periods aboard space stations such as Mir and the ISS. Most recently,
        China has emerged as the third nation with the capability to launch
        independent crewed missions, whilst operators in the commercial sector
        have developed re-usable booster systems and craft launched from
        airborne platforms. In 2020, SpaceX became the first commercial operator
        to successfully launch a crewed mission to the International Space
        Station with Crew Dragon Demo-2, whose name vary depending on the
        organization.
