      The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is an independent
      agency of the U.S. federal government responsible for the civilian space
      program, as well as aeronautics and space research.[note 1] NASA was
      established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee for
      Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency was to have a distinctly civilian
      orientation, encouraging peaceful applications in space science. Since its
      establishment, most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA,
      including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and
      later the Space Shuttle. NASA is supporting the International Space
      Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion spacecraft, the
      Space Launch System, Commercial Crew vehicles, and the planned Lunar
      Gateway space station. The agency is also responsible for the Launch
      Services Program, which provides oversight of launch operations and
      countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches.
